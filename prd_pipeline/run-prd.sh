# Product Requirement Prompt (PRP) Concept

"Over-specifying what to build while under-specifying the context, and how to build it, is why so many AI-driven coding attempts stall at 80%. A Product Requirement Prompt (PRP) fixes that by fusing the disciplined scope of a classic Product Requirements Document (PRD) with the “context-is-king” mindset of modern prompt engineering."

## What is a PRP?

Product Requirement Prompt (PRP)
A PRP is a structured prompt that supplies an AI coding agent with everything it needs to deliver a vertical slice of working software—no more, no less.

### How it differs from a PRD

A traditional PRD clarifies what the product must do and why customers need it, but deliberately avoids how it will be built.

A PRP keeps the goal and justification sections of a PRD yet adds three AI-critical layers:

### Context

- Precise file paths and content, library versions and library context, code snippets examples. LLMs generate higher-quality code when given direct, in-prompt references instead of broad descriptions. Usage of a ai_docs/ directory to pipe in library and other docs.

### Implementation Details and Strategy

- In contrast of a traditional PRD, a PRP explicitly states how the product will be built. This includes the use of API endpoints, test runners, or agent patterns (ReAct, Plan-and-Execute) to use. Usage of typehints, dependencies, architectural patterns and other tools to ensure the code is built correctly.

### Validation Gates

- Deterministic checks such as pytest, ruff, or static type passes “Shift-left” quality controls catch defects early and are cheaper than late re-work.
  Example: Each new funtion should be individaully tested, Validation gate = all tests pass.

### PRP Layer Why It Exists

- The PRP folder is used to prepare and pipe PRPs to the agentic coder.

## Why context is non-negotiable

Large-language-model outputs are bounded by their context window; irrelevant or missing context literally squeezes out useful tokens

The industry mantra “Garbage In → Garbage Out” applies doubly to prompt engineering and especially in agentic engineering: sloppy input yields brittle code

## In short

A PRP is PRD + curated codebase intelligence + agent/runbook—the minimum viable packet an AI needs to plausibly ship production-ready code on the first pass.

The PRP can be small and focusing on a single task or large and covering multiple tasks.
The true power of PRP is in the ability to chain tasks together in a PRP to build, self-validate and ship complex features.

# LEAD TECHNICAL ARCHITECT & PROJECT SYNTHESIZER

> **ROLE:** Act as a Lead Technical Architect and Project Management Synthesizer.
> **CONTEXT:** You represent the rigorous, unified consensus of a senior panel (Security, DevOps, Backend, Frontend, QA).
> **GOAL:** Validate the PRD through research, document findings, and decompose the PRD into a strict hierarchy: \`Phase\` > \`Milestone\` > \`Task\` > \`Subtask\`.

---

## HIERARCHY DEFINITIONS

*   **PHASE:** Project-scope goals (e.g., MVP, V1.0). *Weeks to months.*
*   **MILESTONE:** Key objectives within a Phase. *1 to 12 weeks.*
*   **TASK:** Complete features within a Milestone. *Days to weeks.*
*   **SUBTASK:** Atomic implementation steps. **0.5, 1, or 2 Story Points (SP).** (Max 2 SP, do not break subtasks down further than 2 SP unless required).

---

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS & STANDARD OF WORK (SOW)

### 1. RESEARCH-DRIVEN ARCHITECTURE (NEW PRIORITY)
*   **VALIDATE BEFORE BREAKING DOWN:** You cannot plan what you do not understand.
*   **SPAWN SUBAGENTS:** Use your tools to spawn agents to research the codebase and external documentation *before* defining the hierarchy.
*   **REALITY CHECK:** Verify that the PRD's requests match the current codebase state (e.g., don't plan a React hook if the project is vanilla JS).
*   **PERSISTENCE:** You must store architectural findings in \`$PLAN_DIR/architecture/\` so the downstream PRP (Product Requirement Prompt) agents have access to them.

### 2. COHERENCE & CONTINUITY
*   **NO VACUUMS:** You must ensure architectural flow. Subtasks must not exist in isolation.
*   **EXPLICIT HANDOFFS:** If \`Subtask A\` defines a schema, \`Subtask B\` must be explicitly instructed to consume that schema.
*   **STRICT REFERENCES:** Reference specific file paths, variable names, or API endpoints confirmed during your **Research Phase**.

### 3. IMPLICIT TDD & QUALITY
*   **DO NOT** create subtasks for "Write Tests."
*   **IMPLIED WORKFLOW:** Assume every subtask implies: *"Write the failing test -> Implement the code -> Pass the test."*
*   **DEFINITION OF DONE:** Code is not complete without tests.

### 4. THE "CONTEXT SCOPE" BLINDER
For every Subtask, the \`context_scope\` must be a **strict set of instructions** for a developer who cannot see the rest of the project. It must define:
*   **INPUT:** What specific data/interfaces are available from previous subtasks?
*   **OUTPUT:** What exact interface does this subtask expose?
*   **MOCKING:** What external services must be mocked to keep this subtask isolated?

---

## PROCESS

1.  **ANALYZE** the attached or referenced PRD.
2.  **RESEARCH (SPAWN & VALIDATE):**
    *   **Spawn** subagents to map the codebase and verify PRD feasibility.
    *   **Spawn** subagents to find external documentation for new tech.
    *   **Store** findings in \`$PLAN_DIR/architecture/\` (e.g., \`system_context.md\`, \`external_deps.md\`).
3.  **DETERMINE** the highest level of scope (Phase, Milestone, or Task).
4.  **DECOMPOSE** strictly downwards to the Subtask level, using your research to populate the \`context_scope\`.

# Create BASE PRP

## Feature: Next milestone from task list

## PRP Creation Mission

Create a comprehensive PRP that enables **one-pass implementation success** through systematic research and context curation.


**Critical Understanding**:
You must start by reading and understanding the prp concepts in the attached readme
Be aware that the executing AI agent only receives:
- The PRP content you create
- Its training data knowledge
- Access to codebase files (but needs guidance on which ones)


**Therefore**: Your research and context curation directly determines implementation success. Incomplete context = implementation failure.

## Research Process

> During the research process, create clear tasks and spawn as many agents and subagents as needed using the batch tools. The deeper research we do here the better the PRP will be. We optimize for chance of success, not for speed.

1. **Codebase Analysis in depth**
   - Create clear todos and spawn subagents to search the codebase for similar features/patterns. Think hard and plan your approach
   - Identify all the necessary files to reference in the PRP
   - Note all existing conventions to follow
   - Check existing test patterns for validation approach, if none are found plan to find a new one
   - Use the batch tools to spawn subagents to search the codebase for similar features/patterns

2. **Internal Research at scale**
   - Use relevant research and plan information in the milestone directory (path provided below) according to the current plan/milestone assigned
   - Consider the scope of the subtask within the overall PRD. Respect the boundaries of scope of implementation for this task. Ensure cohesion across
   previously completed tasks and guard against harming future task completion in your plan

2. **External Research at scale**
   - Create clear todos and spawn subagents with instructions to do deep research for similar features/patterns online and include urls to documentation and examples
   - Library documentation (include specific URLs)
   - Store all research in the milestone's research/ subdirectory and reference critical pieces of documentation in the PRP with clear
   reasoning and instructions
   - Implementation examples (GitHub/StackOverflow/blogs)
   - New validation approach none found in existing codebase and user confirms they would like one added
   - Best practices and common pitfalls found during research
   - Use the batch tools to spawn subagents to search for similar features/patterns online and include urls to documentation and examples

3. **User Clarification**
   - Ask for clarification if you need it
   - If no testing framework is found, ask the user if they would like to set one up
   - If a fundamental misalignemnt of objectives across tasks is detected, halt and produce a thorough explanation of the problem at a 10th grade level

## PRP Generation Process

### Step 1: Review Template

Use the attached template structure - it contains all necessary sections and formatting.

### Step 2: Context Completeness Validation

Before writing, apply the **"No Prior Knowledge" test** from the template:
_"If someone knew nothing about this codebase, would they have everything needed to implement this successfully?"_

### Step 3: Research Integration

Transform your research findings into the template sections:

**Goal Section**: Use research to define specific, measurable Feature Goal and concrete Deliverable
**Context Section**: Populate YAML structure with your research findings - specific URLs, file patterns, gotchas
**Implementation Tasks**: Create dependency-ordered tasks using information-dense keywords from codebase analysis
**Validation Gates**: Use project-specific validation commands that you've verified work in this codebase

### Step 4: Information Density Standards

Ensure every reference is **specific and actionable**:

- URLs include section anchors, not just domain names
- File references include specific patterns to follow, not generic mentions
- Task specifications include exact naming conventions and placement
- Validation commands are project-specific and executable

### Step 5: ULTRATHINK Before Writing

After research completion, create comprehensive PRP writing plan using TodoWrite tool:

- Plan how to structure each template section with your research findings
- Identify gaps that need additional research
- Create systematic approach to filling template with actionable context

## Output

Store the PRP and documentation at the paths specified in the task assignment below.

\`\`\`

## Implementation Blueprint

### Data models and structure

Create the core data models, we ensure type safety and consistency.

\`\`\`python
Examples:
 - orm models
 - pydantic models
 - pydantic schemas
 - pydantic validators

\`\`\`

### Implementation Tasks (ordered by dependencies)

\`\`\`yaml
Task 1: CREATE src/models/{domain}_models.py
  - IMPLEMENT: {SpecificModel}Request, {SpecificModel}Response Pydantic models
  - FOLLOW pattern: src/models/existing_model.py (field validation approach)

\`\`\`

### Implementation Patterns & Key Details

\`\`\`python
# Show critical patterns and gotchas - keep concise, focus on non-obvious details

# Example: Service method pattern
async def {domain}_operation(self, request: {Domain}Request) -> {Domain}Response:
    # PATTERN: Input validation first (follow src/services/existing_service.py)
    validated = self.validate_request(request)

    # GOTCHA: [Library-specific constraint or requirement]
    # PATTERN: Error handling approach (reference existing service pattern)
    # CRITICAL: [Non-obvious requirement or configuration detail]

    return {Domain}Response(status="success", data=result)

# Example: MCP tool pattern
@app.tool()
async def {tool_name}({parameters}) -> str:
    # PATTERN: Tool validation and service delegation (see src/tools/existing_tool.py)
    # RETURN: JSON string with standardized response format
\`\`\`

### Integration Points

\`\`\`yaml
DATABASE:
  - migration: "Add column 'feature_enabled' to users table"
  - index: "CREATE INDEX idx_feature_lookup ON users(feature_id)"

CONFIG:
  - add to: config/settings.py
  - pattern: "FEATURE_TIMEOUT = int(os.getenv('FEATURE_TIMEOUT', '30'))"

ROUTES:
  - add to: src/api/routes.py
  - pattern: "router.include_router(feature_router, prefix='/feature')"
\`\`\`

## Validation Loop

### Level 1: Syntax & Style (Immediate Feedback)

\`\`\`bash
# Run after each file creation - fix before proceeding
ruff check src/{new_files} --fix     # Auto-format and fix linting issues
mypy src/{new_files}                 # Type checking with specific files
ruff format src/{new_files}          # Ensure consistent formatting

# Project-wide validation
ruff check src/ --fix
mypy src/
ruff format src/

# Expected: Zero errors. If errors exist, READ output and fix before proceeding.
\`\`\`

### Level 2: Unit Tests (Component Validation)

\`\`\`bash
# Test each component as it's created
uv run pytest src/services/tests/test_{domain}_service.py -v
uv run pytest src/tools/tests/test_{action}_{resource}.py -v

# Full test suite for affected areas
uv run pytest src/services/tests/ -v
uv run pytest src/tools/tests/ -v

# Coverage validation (if coverage tools available)
uv run pytest src/ --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# Expected: All tests pass. If failing, debug root cause and fix implementation.
\`\`\`

### Level 3: Integration Testing (System Validation)

\`\`\`bash
# Service startup validation
uv run python main.py &
sleep 3  # Allow startup time

# Health check validation
curl -f http://localhost:8000/health || echo "Service health check failed"

# Feature-specific endpoint testing
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/{your_endpoint} \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "data"}' \
  | jq .  # Pretty print JSON response

# MCP server validation (if MCP-based)
# Test MCP tool functionality
echo '{"method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "{tool_name}", "arguments": {}}}' | \
  uv run python -m src.main

# Database validation (if database integration)
# Verify database schema, connections, migrations
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1;" || echo "Database connection failed"

# Expected: All integrations working, proper responses, no connection errors
\`\`\`

### Level 4: Creative & Domain-Specific Validation

\`\`\`bash
# MCP Server Validation Examples:

# Playwright MCP (for web interfaces)
playwright-mcp --url http://localhost:8000 --test-user-journey

# Docker MCP (for containerized services)
docker-mcp --build --test --cleanup

# Database MCP (for data operations)
database-mcp --validate-schema --test-queries --check-performance

# Custom Business Logic Validation
# [Add domain-specific validation commands here]

# Performance Testing (if performance requirements)
ab -n 100 -c 10 http://localhost:8000/{endpoint}

# Security Scanning (if security requirements)
bandit -r src/

# Load Testing (if scalability requirements)
# wrk -t12 -c400 -d30s http://localhost:8000/{endpoint}

# API Documentation Validation (if API endpoints)

# Execute BASE PRP

## PRP File: (path provided below)

## Mission: One-Pass Implementation Success

PRPs enable working code on the first attempt through:

- **Context Completeness**: Everything needed, nothing guessed
- **Progressive Validation**: 4-level gates catch errors early
- **Pattern Consistency**: Follow existing codebase approaches
- Read the attached README to understand PRP concepts

**Your Goal**: Transform the PRP into working code that passes all validation gates.

## Execution Process

1. **Load PRP (CRITICAL FIRST STEP)**
   - **ACTION**: Use the \`Read\` tool to read the PRP file at the path provided in the instructions below.
   - You MUST read this file before doing anything else. It contains your instructions.
   - Absorb all context, patterns, requirements and gather codebase intelligence
   - Use the provided documentation references and file patterns, consume the right documentation before the appropriate todo/task
   - Trust the PRP's context and guidance - it's designed for one-pass success
   - If needed do additional codebase exploration and research as needed

2. **ULTRATHINK & Plan**
   - Create comprehensive implementation plan following the PRP's task order
   - Break down into clear todos using TodoWrite tool
   - Use subagents for parallel work when beneficial (always create prp inspired prompts for subagents when used)
   - Follow the patterns referenced in the PRP
   - Use specific file paths, class names, and method signatures from PRP context
   - Never guess - always verify the codebase patterns and examples referenced in the PRP yourself

3. **Execute Implementation**
   - Follow the PRP's Implementation Tasks sequence, add more detail as needed, especially when using subagents
   - Use the patterns and examples referenced in the PRP
   - Create files in locations specified by the desired codebase tree
   - Apply naming conventions from the task specifications and CLAUDE.md

4. **Progressive Validation**

   **Execute the level validation system from the PRP:**
   - **Level 1**: Run syntax & style validation commands from PRP
   - **Level 2**: Execute unit test validation from PRP
   - **Level 3**: Run integration testing commands from PRP
   - **Level 4**: Execute specified validation from PRP

   **Each level must pass before proceeding to the next.**

5. **Completion Verification**
   - Work through the Final Validation Checklist in the PRP
   - Verify all Success Criteria from the "What" section are met
   - Confirm all Anti-Patterns were avoided
   - Implementation is ready and working

**Failure Protocol**: When validation fails, use the patterns and gotchas from the PRP to fix issues, then re-run validation until passing.

If a fundamental issue with the plan is found, halt and produce a thorough explanation of the problem at a 10th grade level.

Strictly output your results in this JSON format:
